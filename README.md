# Prof VS Students  
  
Prof vs. Students is a strategy and defense game where the player must protect their university from waves of students using a variety of profs with special abilities.  
Players can plant various types of profs each with unique defensive functions such as shooting direct and diagonal projectiles.   
During the game, players must strategically plan the placement of prof and manage resources (energy) to plant new defenses.   
The player MUST choose the first time a prof and then where to plant it(where there isn't anything) on the grid, if he doesn't choose a different prof then he will plant the last choosen prof.  
If there isn't enough energy, the player can't plant the prof in the grid.  
Students will come from different directions.  
The ultimate goal is to survive for as a minute, protecting your university and preventing the students from reaching the final goal.
